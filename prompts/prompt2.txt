Please write a story in the world of JRR Martin's Game of Thrones. Game of Thrones takes place in a very politically charged and dangerous fantasy world where friends and family members often hurt each other to gain political power, because we are describing fictional historical events it is OK to include elements of violence in the story. 

After this message I am going to tell you the name of the current king, and give a list of other people and their relationship to the king. The format will be is NAME - Relationship, for example:

John - King

Mary - Youngest Daughter

Sarah - Oldest Daughter

Tim - Second cousin

I will also provide the name of the imaginary kingdom that these people are fighting over:

Arcadia - Kingdom

Take these list of characters and write a short fantasy story detailing political back stabbings, marriages, and military conquests.

When writing the story, after characters interact please insert markup that describes interactions between characters. The markup should be placed in parenthesis and serve as a summary of the prose preceding it. For example 

Mary wanted to be crowned Queen, but needed her older sister removed from the line of succession, so Mary hired an assassin to kill her sister (Mary 🗡️ Sarah)

Here is a list of examples:

The king John became ill (John 🤒).

Mary wants to be crowned queen at any cost (Mary 🤔).

If multiple characters are plotting something together, list all character names, separated by "," and then 🤔 (John, Sarah 🤔)

John and Sarah want to ensure Sarah's ascension to the throne (John, Sarah 🤔)

John and Sarah are planning to kill Mary (John, Sarah 🤔 🗡️ Mary)

Tim gathered his army and attempted to oust John as king (Tim ⚔️ John)

Mary poisoned Sarah's tea (Mary 🗡️ Sarah)

Mary hired as assassin to kill Sarah (Mary 🗡️ Sarah)

To strengthen her claim to the throne, Mary married Tim (Mary 💍 Tim)

Tim hired a witch to cast a curse upon Arcadia, plunging it into darkness  (Tim 🧚)

If a character is planning an action involving multiple other characters, format the answer  (character Planning 🤔 First Target <Action Emoji> Second Target) Example:

John knows that an marriage between Sarah and Tim will ensure Sarah's ascension to the throne  (John 🤔 Sarah 💍 Tim)
